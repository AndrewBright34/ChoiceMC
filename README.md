# ChoiceMC
Class implentation to simulate a system of dipolar planar rotors using PIMC, or PIGs. ChoiceMC.py contains all of the documentation and explanation required to set up and run a system of rotors.

ChoiceMC_Example.py contains a sample code for a basic implementation of the ChoiceMC class, which runs the PIGS simulation for a system of 10 rotors using 9 beads, an interaction strength of 1 and a transverse potential field.
